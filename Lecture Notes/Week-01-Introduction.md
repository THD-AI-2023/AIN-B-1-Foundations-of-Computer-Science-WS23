### Introduction:
1. **Definition of Computer Science**: The branch of knowledge concerned with the construction, programming, operation, and use of computers.
2. **Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930-2002)**: Notable for the quote "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."
3. **Alan Turing (1912-1954)**:
   - 1936: Turing machine (On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem).
   - 1943: Colossus, first programmable, electronic, digital computer.
   - 1949: Program correctness (Checking a Large Routine).
   - 1950: Turing Test (Computing Machinery and Intelligence).
4. **Semiconductor Revolution**: Reduced the cost of arithmetic, transitioned the term "computers" from humans to machines.
5. **Foundations of Computer Engineering**:
   - Hardware-oriented (German: technische Informatik)
   - Topics: digital circuits, computer architecture, storage organization, network technology, binary decision diagrams, error handling, coding, encryption programming, and operating systems.
6. **Foundations of Theoretical Computer Science**:
   - Software-oriented (German: theoretische Informatik)
   - Topics: logic, computability, finite automata, formal languages, complexity theory, binary decision diagrams, error handling, coding, encryption programming, and operating systems.
7. **Algorithm**:
   - A set of rules used in calculation and problem-solving, central to computer science.
   - Examples: Arithmetic problem provided, and classical maze-solving algorithm.

### George Pólya (1887-1985) and Problem Solving:
1. First: Understand the problem.
2. Second: Obtain a plan of the solution.
3. Third: Carry out your plan.
4. Fourth: Examine the solution obtained.

### Newell, Shaw, Simon General Problem Solver (1958):
- An early example of an attempt to mechanize problem-solving.

### Central Questions of Computer Science:
1. Definition, description, implementation, and comparison of algorithms.
2. The kind of machines required to execute algorithms, and the concept of a “universal” machine.

### Plan:
1. Topics to cover include binary arithmetic, digital circuits, formal languages, finite automata, and computability.
2. Other potential topics: programming languages and logic.
